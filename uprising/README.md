## Rules

Each player receives 2 suits of cards, and lines them up A-K.  This is their card supply.
They then take two aces in hand, and a joker in hand.

On each round:
- Each player secretly decides some cards to play, by putting them in front of the joker.
- When both are done, they put their decks face down to commit to the play (so the cards to be played are below the joker).
- Once both have committed, the decks are turned face up, and all cards in front of the joker are in play.
  The rest of the cards go back to hand.
- If a player did not play any cards, they receive all their A from supply.
- During play, we begin resolving effects of cards.  We resolve effects in order of rank, low to high, starting from A-K.
  All cards of the same rank are resolved simultaneously.  (While a card's effect is being resolved, it is not considered in play.)
- After a card's effect is resolved, it attempts to promote.
  To promote, it returns to their supply, and the player takes to hand the card of higher rank.
  Exception: the King promotes back to Queen.
  If the card cannot promote (i.e. both cards of higher rank are in play or in hand), it returns to hand.
- A player wins as soon as they have both King and Queen in hand (not in play!).
  Both players can win at the same time - the game can then be considered a tie.

Possible variant: at beginning, these choose 1 2-4, 1 5-7, and 1 8-10
Possible variant: game ends after fixed # of turns, score is sum total of ranks?
